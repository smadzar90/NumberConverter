# Number Conversion Program

The program inputs the number and converts it to different base as chosen in the menu. The program accepts conversion with binary, decimal and hexadecimal number formats. 
We can choose signed or unsigned options, as well as 2 complement of the number. </br><br/>



## Compile and Run
<br/>

### Terminal
<br/>

> **TODO**. cd pathname/numberconverter <br/>
> **TODO**. javac NumberConverter.java TestNumberConverter.java <br/>
> **TODO**. cd pathname/java <br/>
> **TODO**. java com.mycompany.numberconverter.TestNumberConverter <br/>

## Example 
<br/>

```
-> Converting from hexadecimal to binary(Expample):

NUMBER CONVERSION PROGRAM

Options:
1. 16-bit binary number to unsigned decimal integer
2. Unsigned decimal integer to 16-bit binary number
3. 16-bit binary number to unsigned hexadecimal integer
4. Unsigned hexadecimal integer to 16-bit binary number
5. Signed decimal number to 16-bit binary 2’s complement signed integer number
6. 16-bit binary 2’s complement signed integer number to signed decimal

Select an option(1-6): 4

Enter an unsigned hexadecimal integer(Ex: F18D): 4FA


Unsigned hexadecimal integer --> 4FA

Equals: 

16-bit binary number --> 0000010011111010

```
